# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use _putchar
- You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called holberton.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file


# TASKS

0. _putchar mandatory
File: 0-holberton.c
Score: 100.00% (Checks completed: 100.00%)
Write a program that prints Holberton, followed by a new line.

- The program should return 0
```
julien@ubuntu:~/0x02$  gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra _putchar.c 0-holberton.c -o 0-holberton
julien@ubuntu:~/0x02$ ./0-holberton 
Holberton
julien@ubuntu:~/0x02$ 
```


1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game mandatory
File: 1-alphabet.c
Score: 100.00% (Checks completed: 100.00%)
Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
- You can only use _putchar twice in your code
```
julien@ubuntu:~/0x02$ cat 1-main.c
#include "holberton.h"

/**
 * main - check the code for Holberton School students.
 *
 * Return: Always 0.
 */
int main(void)
{
    print_alphabet();
    return (0);
}
julien@ubuntu:~/0x02$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra _putchar.c 1-main.c 1-alphabet.c -o 1-alphabet
julien@ubuntu:~/0x02$ ./1-alphabet 
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
julien@ubuntu:~/0x02$
```
